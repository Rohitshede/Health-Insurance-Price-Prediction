# Health Insurance Price Prediction
## Overview
This project aims to predict health insurance prices based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking habits, region, etc. The prediction model is built using machine learning techniques to assist insurance companies in accurately pricing their policies.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggel. It consists of 1338 entries and 7 features, including:

- Age
- Sex
- BMI (Body Mass Index)
- Childern
- Smoking status
- Region
- Charges (target)

## Usage
Run the Jupyter notebook "Health_Insurance_Prediction.ipynb" to see the data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and predictions.
Modify the notebook as needed for experimenting with different models, features, or parameters.

## Model Evaluation
- We evaluate the model's performance using MAE, MSE, R2_Score.
- Cross-validation techniques are employed to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.

## Future Improvements
- Explore additional features that could enhance prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with more advanced machine learning algorithms.
- Optimize hyperparameters for better model performance.
- Deployment of the model for real-time predictions.
